<p>
Today Kali Linux 2019.4 just launched, and I'm so excited to announce that, for 
the last two months, I've been working together with the Kali team developing 
all its new look. The first noticeable change is the move from Gnome to 
Xfce as the default desktop. This change was made to make default Kali more 
comfortable for low resource computers, as it is also commonly used on small 
ARM devices that don't have as high performance as an average desktop.
</p>
<p>
If you don't want to leave Gnome, don't worry. Kali now offers a Gnome build 
for you with some of the new desktop themes. As this release was focused on the 
Xfce DE change, most of the latest changes were intended for this desktop. For 
next releases, more changes will be available for all kali flavors to get them 
"close" to a similar user experience no matter the environment you run.

</ul>
<h2>How to restore the new Kali appearance</h2>
<p>
If you are using a previous Kali installation with Xfce, you may want to try 
the new redesign. This script can be useful as well if you want to revert all 
the changes you made to your desktop.
</p>
<pre>
    <span class="kw2">rm</span> -rf ~/.config/xfce4
    <span class="kw2">pkill</span> -u $(<span class="kw2">whoami</span>)
</pre>
If you want to restore not only Xfce but all the app settings remove completely 
<code>~/.config</code>
<br>
If you want not only to restore the DE but to completely wipe your user 
settings and modification remove <code>~/.config</code> <code>~/.cache</code> 
<code>~/.local</code>
<br>
After this you will need to reboot your system to see the changes.

</div>
<p>
Another cool feature that comes with this new Kali release is the support of 
Fira Code font for both the text editor and the terminal. Fira Code makes use 
of font ligatures to join multiple characters into a single logical symbol. 
Unfortunately, GTK terminals don't support font ligatures, so the default 
terminal has been replaced with qterminal.

<h2>Undercover Mode</h2>
<p>
    NOUP that isn't windows!! Impressed? üòâ
<p>
<p>
The picture above shows Kali Linux using the new Undercover Mode that allows 
you to be unnoticed with just a simple click. When you run it while in normal 
mode, it will save all your desktop settings and enable this 'incognito' mode 
to make your desktop look as similar as possible to Windows 10. Opening it 
again will restore all your previous desktop appearance so that you won't lose 
any of your beloved customizations.

Imagine you are working in a public place; hacking with a giant dragon on your 
wallpaper seems a bit obvious, and people might get curious (or angry). For 
sure, not the best situation if you want to stay unseen, so the Kali team 
proposed an undercover mode, and I was encharged of its development. The themes 
are a modification of <a href="https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-10" target="_blank">Elbullazul Windows 10</a> 
ones, which I added a script to be able to save and restore all the desktop 
settings.
