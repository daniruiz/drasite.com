<h4>Finally! I've added a blog to my personal website ðŸ˜Ž</h4>
<p>Since I created this website I've been using it as a personal portfolio and a place to share my projects with the
    world. But many times I've felt I wanted to upload something less serious, not just projects. Something like
    tutorials, cool tech related posts, or just my thoughts... That's why I've just opened this blog and I hope I'll be
    adding lots of posts soon.</p>
